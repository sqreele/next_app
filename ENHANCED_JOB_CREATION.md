## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New columns added to work_orders table
ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN title VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN estimated_duration INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN safety_requirements TEXT;
ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN required_tools TEXT;
ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN required_parts TEXT;
ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN special_instructions TEXT;
ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN cost_estimate FLOAT;

-- Modified existing columns
ALTER TABLE work_orders ALTER COLUMN machine_id DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE work_orders ALTER COLUMN priority DROP NOT NULL;
```

#### API Schema Updates
- Updated `WorkOrderBase`, `WorkOrderCreate`, and `WorkOrderUpdate` schemas
- Added validation for new fields with appropriate constraints
- Enhanced error handling and validation messages

#### CRUD Operations
- Enhanced work order creation with new field support
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing work orders
- Improved topic association handling

### Frontend Changes

#### Enhanced Form Components
- Comprehensive form with 6 main sections:
  1. Work Order Type Selection
  2. Basic Information
  3. Technical Details
  4. Scheduling & Assignment
  5. Safety & Requirements
  6. Topics & Instructions
  7. File Attachments

#### Improved Validation
- Client-side validation with Zod schema
- Conditional validation based on work order type
- Real-time feedback and error display
- Form state management with React Hook Form

#### Better User Experience
- Loading states and error handling
- File upload with progress tracking
- Topic selection with visual feedback
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Preventive Maintenance Work Order

```typescript
const pmWorkOrder = {
  type: 'pm',
  title: 'Monthly HVAC Filter Replacement',
  description: 'Replace air filters in main HVAC unit and inspect system',
  machine_id: 15,
  procedure_id: 8,
  priority: 'Medium',
  frequency: 'Monthly',
  estimated_duration: 60,
  safety_requirements: 'PPE required: safety glasses, gloves',
  required_tools: 'Screwdriver set, flashlight',
  required_parts: '2x HEPA filters, cleaning supplies',
  cost_estimate: 75.00,
  topic_ids: [1, 3, 7]
}
```

### Creating an Issue Report

```typescript
const issueWorkOrder = {
  type: 'issue',
  title: 'Pump Vibration Issue',
  description: 'Excessive vibration detected in main circulation pump',
  machine_id: 22,
  priority: 'High',
  estimated_duration: 120,
  safety_requirements: 'LOTO procedures required',
  required_tools: 'Vibration meter, alignment tools',
  special_instructions: 'Check motor alignment and bearing condition',
  cost_estimate: 250.00
}
```

### Creating a General Work Order

```typescript
const generalWorkOrder = {
  type: 'workorder',
  title: 'Install New Lighting',
  description: 'Install LED lighting in warehouse section B',
  estimated_duration: 180,
  safety_requirements: 'Working at height - safety harness required',
  required_tools: 'Ladder, drill, wire strippers',
  required_parts: '6x LED fixtures, electrical wire, junction boxes',
  cost_estimate: 400.00,
  room_id: 12
}
```

## Benefits

### üë• **For Managers**
- Better resource planning with duration and cost estimates
- Comprehensive safety requirement tracking
- Detailed work specifications reduce miscommunication
- Enhanced reporting capabilities with rich data

### üîß **For Technicians**
- Clear work instructions and requirements
- Safety information readily available
- Tool and parts lists for preparation
- Visual documentation support

### üè¢ **For Organizations**
- Improved compliance with detailed safety requirements

## Migration Notes

The enhanced system is fully backward compatible with existing work orders. Existing work orders will continue to function normally, and new fields will be optional for existing records.

To fully utilize the enhanced features:

1. Run the database migration to add new columns
2. Update frontend components to use the new form
3. Train users on the enhanced functionality
4. Gradually migrate existing work order templates to use new fields

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with inventory management for parts tracking
- Advanced cost analysis and reporting
- Mobile app support for field technicians
- Integration with scheduling systems
- Automated work order generation based on equipment conditions
- Advanced workflow management with approval processes
