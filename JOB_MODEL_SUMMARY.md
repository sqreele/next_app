# Job Model Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive Job model and implementation for the PM System with all the required properties you specified.

## Job Model Properties

The Job model includes all the requested properties:

- **job_id** - Primary key (`id` field in the model)
- **user_id** - Foreign key to the User table
- **topic** - String field for the job topic/title
- **property** - String field for property information
- **before_image** - File path for before image
- **after_image** - File path for after image  
- **room_id** - Foreign key to the Room table (optional)
- **status** - Enum field with job statuses (PENDING, ASSIGNED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, ON_HOLD)

## Additional Fields Added

- **description** - Text field for detailed job description
- **created_at** - Timestamp when job was created
- **updated_at** - Timestamp when job was last updated  
- **started_at** - Timestamp when job was started
- **completed_at** - Timestamp when job was completed

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Model (`backend/my_app/models.py`)
- Added `JobStatus` enum with 6 status values
- Created `Job` model with all required fields and relationships
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Established relationships with User and Room models

### 2. Pydantic Schemas (`backend/my_app/schemas.py`)
- `JobBase` - Base schema with common fields
- `JobCreate` - Schema for creating new jobs
- `JobUpdate` - Schema for updating existing jobs
- `Job` - Full job schema with all fields
- `JobSummary` - Condensed job information
- `JobStats` - Statistics schema for dashboard
- `JobActivity` - Activity tracking schema

### 3. CRUD Operations (`backend/my_app/crud.py`)
- Added `CRUDJob` class with specialized methods:
  - `get_with_relations()` - Get job with user and room data
  - `get_by_status()` - Filter jobs by status
  - `get_by_user()` - Get jobs for specific user
  - `get_by_room()` - Get jobs for specific room
  - `get_recent_jobs()` - Get recent jobs within date range
  - `update_status()` - Update job status with automatic timestamps

### 4. API Routes (`backend/my_app/routers/jobs.py`)
- `POST /jobs/` - Create new job
- `GET /jobs/` - List jobs with filters
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}` - Get specific job
- `PUT /jobs/{job_id}` - Update job
- `PATCH /jobs/{job_id}/status` - Update job status
- `DELETE /jobs/{job_id}` - Delete job (requires supervisor+ role)
- `GET /jobs/status/{status}` - Get jobs by status
- `GET /jobs/user/{user_id}` - Get jobs for user
- `GET /jobs/room/{room_id}` - Get jobs for room
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/images/before` - Upload before image
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/images/after` - Upload after image
- `GET /jobs/stats/summary` - Get job statistics

### 5. Admin Panel (`backend/my_app/admin.py`)
- Added `JobAdmin` class for web-based administration
- Custom display methods for user and room names
- Status badges with color coding
- Image link displays
- Proper form configurations for create/edit operations

### 6. Database Migration (`backend/alembic/versions/add1234567890_add_jobs_table.py`)
- Created Alembic migration file for adding the jobs table
- Includes all columns, constraints, and indexes
- Proper upgrade/downgrade functions

## API Usage Examples

### Create a Job
```json
POST /api/v1/jobs/
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "topic": "Fix broken air conditioner",
  "property": "Main building HVAC system",
  "room_id": 5,
  "description": "AC unit in conference room not cooling properly"
}
```

### Update Job Status
```json
PATCH /api/v1/jobs/123/status
{
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
}
```

### Upload Before Image
```bash
POST /api/v1/jobs/123/images/before
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
[image file]
```

## Database Schema

The jobs table includes the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    topic VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    property VARCHAR(500),
    before_image VARCHAR(500),
    after_image VARCHAR(500),
    room_id INTEGER REFERENCES rooms(id),
    status jobstatus NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Integration Points

- **Users**: Jobs are assigned to users via user_id foreign key
- **Rooms**: Jobs can be associated with specific rooms via room_id
- **File Management**: Before/after images are stored as file paths
- **Admin Panel**: Full CRUD operations available in web interface
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for all job operations
- **Dashboard**: Job statistics can be displayed on dashboards

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. Run the database migration to create the jobs table
2. Test the API endpoints
3. Add job management to the frontend UI
4. Configure file upload directories for images
5. Add job notifications/alerts if needed

The Job model is now fully integrated into the PM System and ready for use!
