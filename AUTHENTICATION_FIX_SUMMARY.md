# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing 401 (Unauthorized) errors with the message "Session expired or invalid" when trying to fetch topics. The error logs showed:
- `[ResponseInterceptor] 401 received, but no refresh token available. Logging out.`
- `Service error fetching topics: ApiError: Session expired or invalid.`

## Root Cause
1. **Short Token Expiration**: Access tokens were set to expire after only 30 minutes
2. **No Refresh Token Logic**: The frontend had no mechanism to automatically refresh expired tokens
3. **Immediate Logout**: When a 401 error occurred, the system immediately logged out users instead of attempting to refresh the token
4. **Flawed Refresh Endpoint**: The backend refresh token endpoint required a valid token to refresh, which defeated its purpose

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Extended Token Expiration Time
- **Backend**: Increased `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` from 30 to 60 minutes
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/my_app/security.py`
  - `backend/my_app/routers/auth.py`

### 2. Improved Backend Refresh Token Endpoint
- **Enhanced Logic**: Modified the refresh token endpoint to accept slightly expired tokens (within 5 minutes of expiration)
- **Grace Period**: Added a 5-minute grace period for token refresh
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and validation
- **File Modified**: `backend/my_app/routers/auth.py`

### 3. Frontend Token Refresh Implementation

#### A. API Client Enhancements (`frontend/my_job/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- **Automatic Refresh**: Added response interceptor that automatically attempts token refresh on 401 errors
- **Request Queuing**: Implemented request queuing to handle multiple concurrent requests during token refresh
- **Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism for failed requests after successful token refresh
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Improved error messages and user experience

#### B. Auth Store Enhancements (`frontend/my_job/src/stores/auth-store.ts`)
- **Refresh Token Method**: Added `refreshToken()` method to handle token refresh
- **Proactive Refresh**: Implemented `setupTokenRefresh()` for proactive token refresh before expiration
- **Timer Management**: Added automatic timer setup to refresh tokens 5 minutes before expiration
- **Better State Management**: Enhanced token and user state management

#### C. Separate Auth API Service (`frontend/my_job/src/services/auth-api.ts`)
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Created separate service to avoid circular imports
- **Dedicated Refresh Logic**: Isolated refresh token functionality

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Better handling of refresh failures
- **User Notifications**: Improved toast messages for user feedback
- **Debugging Support**: Added console logging for troubleshooting

## Key Features

### Automatic Token Refresh
- Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire
- Proactive refresh 5 minutes before expiration
- Queued request handling during refresh

### Improved User Experience
- No more sudden logouts due to expired tokens
- User-friendly error messages
- Seamless token refresh in the background

### Better Error Recovery
- Graceful handling of refresh failures
- Automatic logout only when refresh is impossible
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Testing
Created `test_token_refresh.py` to verify the refresh functionality works correctly.

## Usage
The token refresh system works automatically in the background. Users will experience:
1. **Seamless Operation**: No interruption when tokens are refreshed
2. **Extended Sessions**: Longer session duration (60 minutes instead of 30)
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear feedback when authentication issues occur

## Files Modified
1. `backend/my_app/security.py` - Extended token expiration
2. `backend/my_app/routers/auth.py` - Improved refresh endpoint
3. `frontend/my_job/src/lib/api-client.ts` - Added refresh logic
4. `frontend/my_job/src/stores/auth-store.ts` - Enhanced auth management
5. `frontend/my_job/src/services/auth-api.ts` - New auth service
6. `test_token_refresh.py` - Test script

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation thoroughly
2. Monitor for any remaining authentication issues
3. Consider implementing refresh tokens for even longer sessions
4. Add monitoring and alerting for authentication failures
